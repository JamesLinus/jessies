.SH NAME
edit-and-block \- wait while a file is edited in Evergreen
.SH SYNOPSIS
edit-and-block FILE
.SH DESCRIPTION
A synonym for "evergreen \-\-block FILE".
This is useful if you're asked for a blocking editor command and are unable to supply arguments, as with crontab(1).

(Arguably it would have been simpler to have evergreen(1) block by default but support a \-\-no\-block option, but that would have been unfortunate for interactive use.)
